# Hackintosh-GA-B85N-Phoenix
hackintosh config for Gigabyte GA-B85N Phoenix-WIFI

#Intallation

There are two efi folders present one with network drivers for intel and another without.
Just rename the folder you wish to use to EFI and copy it to your EFI partition.

#Supported GPUs
The following at the GPU I have tested and work without further modification (working HDMI Audio)

* Intel HD 4600
* RX 460 4GB
* RX 480 4GB
* GT 710
* GTX 750 Ti
* GTX 750

other cards should work but be aware nothing higher from Nvidia then a GTX 780 will work.


#Bluetooth
No Bluetoother support for this board though an ASUS USB-BT400 can provide basic bluetooth needs for mice and keyboards functions such as air drop will not work

#WIFI
The built in WIFI for this board does not work with BIG SUR though using an offical air port card such as an Airport BCM94360CS2 with a mini PCI-E adapter works without further configration.
